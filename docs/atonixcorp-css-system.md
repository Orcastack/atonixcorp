# Dropdown Visibility and Responsive Menus

All dropdowns use the `--color-dropdown-*` tokens in `app/src/styles/tokens.css`.
Native `select`, `option`, and `optgroup` controls receive an explicit surface and
text color in `app/src/styles/unified.css`, so they cannot inherit white text on a
white popup. Reusable profile and workspace menus use the same contract, including
hover, active, keyboard-focus, and touch-safe mobile target styles.

At widths below 1024px, profile and workspace dropdowns reassert their tokenized
surface, border, and text colors and use 48px menu-item targets. At widths below
768px, native selects reassert the same surface and text colors. Regular mobile
navigation links use the dropdown ink token; white utility-link text is reserved
for the explicit dark utility surface. This keeps phone, tablet, and desktop menus
legible in both light and dark themes.

For a future dark theme, set `data-theme="dark"` on the application root. The
dropdown tokens then switch together; do not set isolated menu text or background
colors in feature CSS.

# AtonixCorp CSS System

AtonixCorp uses one shared CSS contract for public pages, authenticated dashboards, subscription views, and future modules.

## Import order

The stylesheet spine is loaded from `app/src/index.js`:

1. `styles/theme.css` provides compatibility aliases.
2. `styles/globals.css` loads tokens, base elements, components, and layout rules.
3. Page-specific styles provide local layout details.
4. `styles/unified.css` enforces the shared visual contract.
5. `styles/creation-system.css` is loaded after the unified baseline and defines the provisioning-flow contract.

New feature styles should use the existing tokens and should not introduce a second font, palette, spacing scale, or button system.

## Typography

The platform uses bundled IBM Plex Sans for interface text and IBM Plex Mono for code or data that benefits from fixed-width alignment.

- Page titles (`h1`): 24-32px, bold.
- Section titles (`h2`): 20-24px, bold.
- Body text: 16px, regular, 1.5 line height.
- Labels and metadata: 14px, semibold.

## Palette

Use the semantic variables instead of raw color values:

- Authority: `--color-navy-950`, `--color-navy-900`, `--color-navy-800`.
- Technology accents: `--color-blue-700`, `--color-blue-600`, `--color-blue-100`.
- Surfaces and borders: `--color-white`, `--color-silver-100`, `--color-silver-200`, `--color-silver-300`.
- Text: `--color-heading`, `--color-text`, `--color-silver-700`.
- Status: `--color-success`, `--color-warning`, `--color-error`, `--color-info`.

Avoid raw colors, neon effects, glow treatments, decorative gradients, and page-specific brand colors.

## Enterprise Dashboards

Organization dashboards use a white and cool-gray canvas with blue for navigation
and interactive controls, green for positive performance, and amber or red only
for status conditions. Dashboard panels, metrics, tabs, and resource cards use a
1px border, 2px corner radius, and restrained shadow. Metric labels are 11px
uppercase metadata; values are 25px bold figures with no decorative gradients.
Keep dashboard grids at four metrics on wide screens, two on tablet, and one on
mobile. Tabs use a blue bottom border for the active state and a gray hover fill.

### Organization Overview Console

`EnterpriseOrgOverview` uses the shared enterprise tokens through its
`.org-dashboard-page` scope. Its header is always a white surface with a silver
bottom separator; orange or red header treatments are not permitted. Keep metric
labels, values, and supporting text in the existing three-row card layout so
financial zero values remain legible and aligned. The card's colored left rule is
the visual indicator: blue is neutral, green is positive performance, and amber
is reserved for tax attention.

Quick-action cards remain neutral surfaces. The Reports action alone may use the
`#4f46e5` to `#818cf8` horizontal gradient as a 3px top rail, never as a page
background, card fill, or header treatment. On small screens, organization tabs
scroll horizontally and metric grids reduce from four columns to two and then one
without changing the card hierarchy.

## Layout and components

Use the 12-column grid patterns already established by page shells. The standard rhythm is 16px for controls and local spacing, 24px for grouped content, and 32px for section separation. Cards use an 8px maximum radius, a 1px silver border, and the shared shadow tokens.

Use the shared classes when they apply:

- `.page-header`, `.page-title`, `.page-subtitle`, `.page-actions`
- `.card`, `.surface-card`, `.panel`, `.table-wrapper`
- `.btn`, `.btn-primary`, `.btn-secondary`, `.btn-outline`
- `.badge`, `.status-badge`, `.pill`
- `.ui-table`

Forms inherit consistent input sizing, focus rings, labels, and borders from `globals.css` and `unified.css`.

## Creation Flows

Organization, company, department, entity, and workspace creation flows use `styles/creation-system.css`. Apply `.creation-flow` to the page root and compose its reusable primitives with local layout classes:

- `.creation-card` for a primary step surface.
- `.creation-summary-card` for review, license, user, package, or module summaries.
- `.creation-option-card` and `.creation-module-card` for selectable cards.
- `.creation-field`, `.creation-label`, and `.creation-control` for form controls.
- `.creation-description` for helper or supporting copy.

Creation surfaces and controls are deliberately square: `--creation-radius` is `0`. All text uses IBM Plex Sans, controls are 44px high, labels are 13px semibold, helper text is 13px with a 20px line height, and spacing uses 8px, 16px, 24px, and 32px increments. Do not add gradients, decorative shapes, pills, or a local card/input system to these flows.

## Adding a module

1. Import only the module stylesheet needed for layout-specific rules.
2. Use semantic variables from `tokens.css` for colors, spacing, typography, borders, and elevation.
3. Prefer shared primitives over new card, button, or form variants.
4. Keep mobile behavior within the module stylesheet or the shared breakpoint at 760px.
5. Run `npm run build` before opening a pull request.
